# Free-charge-generation-in-Y6-theory
Data and code for theoretical modelling associated with the paper "Free Charge Photogeneration in a Single Component High Photovoltaic Efficiency Organic Semiconductor" Things still need to be tidied up a bit, but hopefully people are able to find their way around without too much trouble.

If you have any questions please get in touch at paulalexanderhume@gmail.com. 

Experimental data and code from the paper can be found at https://github.com/Mikebprice/Free-charge-generation-in-Y6
