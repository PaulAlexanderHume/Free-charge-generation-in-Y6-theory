# Free-charge-generation-in-Y6-theory
This project contains data and code for theoretical modelling associated with our paper "Free Charge Photogeneration in a Single Component High Photovoltaic Efficiency Organic Semiconductor". 

Things still need to be tidied up, but hopefully people can find their way around without too much trouble.
If you have any questions please get in touch at paulalexanderhume@gmail.com.

I'm also very happy to discuss the interpretation of the experiments, but the assocated data and code can be found at https://github.com/Mikebprice/Free-charge-generation-in-Y6.
